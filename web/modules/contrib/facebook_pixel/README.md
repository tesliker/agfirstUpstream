# Facebook Pixel
This module implements a Facebook Tracking Pixel to track your users.

### Requirements
* none


### Installation

0) Create a Facebook Pixel under https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/pixel/

1) Activate the module.

2) Enter your Facebook Tracking ID in /admin/config/facebook_pixel.

3) Go and drink a coffee or tee... or at least some water, you deserve it :)

### Upgrading from Drupal 7

Sites upgraded from Drupal 7 will have Facebook Pixel ID automatically imported
into the new site. The other settings are not included and will need to be set
manually.

### ADD ON Modules

* Facebook Pixel Commerce

#### TODO
* Make the trackable events configurable (Now only the "PageView"
event is hardcoded available) -> Patches are welcome :)
